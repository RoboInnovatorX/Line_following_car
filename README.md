# Line_following_car
This Arduino sketch implements a simple line-following car using infrared sensors. The car has defined motor and sensor pins, and it follows a line based on the readings from the infrared sensors. Motor control and line-following conditions are organized into a more readable structure using helper functions and lambda expressions.
